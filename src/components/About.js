      <p className="aboutpara">Hi, I’m Archita — a curious learner, creative thinker, and a passionate individual with a drive to grow and build meaningful things.
         I love exploring new ideas, learning new skills, and using technology as a tool to solve real-world problems.
         Whether it's diving into the world of web development, experimenting with design, or picking up new challenges,
          I bring dedication and a fresh perspective to everything I do.
          Currently, I’m working on sharpening my skills in React, JavaScript, and full-stack development. Along the way, 
          I’ve also developed a love for UI/UX design and content creation.
